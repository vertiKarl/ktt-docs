### Pirate Captain

- **Team:** None (Changes based on the player they are bound to)
- **Goal:** Serve the master (the player who holds the Contract).
- **Minimum Players:** 7
- **Characteristics:**
  - The Pirate Captain starts with a "Contract" item, which binds them to a player when thrown and picked up.
  - The Captain does not directly fight for any team until the Contract is thrown and picked up.
  - Once a player picks up the Contract, the Captain and all Pirates serve that player as their master.
  - If the Captain dies, a new Captain is chosen among the Pirates, but they are not bound by the previous Captain's contracts and can search for a new master.
