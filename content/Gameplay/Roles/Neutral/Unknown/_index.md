- **Team:** Unknown (Own team)
- **Goal:** Get killed and join your killer's team.
- **Minimum Players:** 5
- **Characteristics:**
  - The Unknown plays in their own team and loses if they survive until the end of the round.
  - If the Unknown is killed by another player, they respawn as that player's role and help them win.
  - This creates a bond of trust between the Unknown and the killer, as they confirm each other's identity.
  - The Unknown and the killer are now on the same side after the respawn.
