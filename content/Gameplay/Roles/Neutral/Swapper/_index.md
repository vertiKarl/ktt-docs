- **Team:** Jester
- **Goal:** Get killed by someone and swap identities with them.
- **Minimum Players:** 8
- **Characteristics:**
  - The **Swapper** is a **Jester** role that cannot deal damage. They appear as a Jester to Traitors, which is a strategic advantage when manipulating others.
  - Their goal is to be killed by another player, triggering an identity swap. Upon death, they will swap roles and weapons with the player that kills them.
  - By default, the player who kills the Swapper becomes the new Swapper, but with only **1 health**.
  - The resulting chaos is often unpredictable, as the new Swapper can either use the new role to continue the game or face immediate challenges.
